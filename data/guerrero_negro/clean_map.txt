Microbial mat samples were collected as cores (~1 cm x 5 cm) at ~14:00 from pond 4 (near pond 5) at the Exportadora de Sal Saltworks, Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Cores were field sectioned unfrozen into 23 layers, 1 mm sections in the uppermost 1 cm and 3 mm sections in the lower mat. Sections from four cores taken within ~ 0.25 m2 were pooled to minimize influence of patchiness on the stratification profile. Dissected samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for transport to the laboratory. Genomic DNA was extracted from each layer by phenol:chloroform as described (Ley et al 2006).  Each sample DNA was used to construct two independent libraries.  PCR reactions to amplify 16S rRNA genes were conducted (30 cycles with annealing temperature of 52C) with the bacterial domain-specific primers 27F and 1492R (Weisburg et al 1991).
